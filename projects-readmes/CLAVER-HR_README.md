## AI Analytics
### Mechanism:
- Analyze each applicant's strengths and weaknesses based on their application data and résumé content.
- Use a predefined rubric (e.g., "Experience", "Skills", "Education") to evaluate candidates against the role's requirements.
- Generate a comprehensive report for each applicant, highlighting areas of strength and weakness.
- After analysis of all applicants, provide an overall summary of the candidate pool, identifying common strengths and weaknesses across all applicants and evaluating the overall fit of the candidate pool for the role.

## Overview

Claver HR lets companies publish job openings on a branded public page and track candidates through a fully customizable hiring pipeline.

**For hiring teams:**
- Create job roles with custom application form fields
- Track applicants through configurable pipeline stages (Pending → Accepted → Rejected, or any custom flow)
- View analytics — total applications, trends, stage distribution
- Email candidates directly from the platform
- Export applications to CSV
- Manage team members and company settings

**For candidates:**
- Browse open roles on the company's public job board at `yourapp.com/[company-slug]`
- Submit an application with a role-specific form (no account required)

---

## Features

- **Multi-tenancy** — each company has its own slug, job board, users, and data
- **Dynamic application forms** — define custom fields per role (text, textarea, select, file upload, etc.)
- **Hiring pipeline** — per-role stages with full progression history tracked on a timeline
- **File storage** — résumé uploads to Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible); served via short-lived presigned URLs
- **Email** — send templated emails to candidates via Resend; full email history on every application
- **Email templates** — reusable Handlebars templates with variable substitution (`{{candidateName}}`, `{{roleName}}`, `{{companyName}}`)
- **JWT auth** — access + refresh token pair; refresh tokens are rotated on every use and stored in the DB
- **Automated test report** — runs Vitest (backend) + Playwright (E2E) and emails an HTML report

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- npm v8+
- PostgreSQL (local or remote)
- A [Resend](https://resend.com) API key (for email)
- A Cloudflare R2 or AWS S3 bucket (for file uploads)

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs dependencies for all workspaces in one step.

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create `apps/api/.env`:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/claver-hr"

# JWT secrets (use long random strings)
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your-access-secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-refresh-secret

# Admin bootstrap secret (used when creating the first company/user)
ADMIN_SECRET=your-admin-secret

# Cloudflare R2 / AWS S3
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
R2_BUCKET_NAME=
R2_ENDPOINT=
R2_PUBLIC_URL=

# Email (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
RESEND_FROM="Claver HR <no-reply@yourdomain.com>"
```

### 3. Set up the database

```bash
cd apps/api
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### 4. Start the servers

Open two terminals from the project root:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — API
npm run dev:api
# → http://localhost:3001
# → API docs at http://localhost:3001/docs

# Terminal 2 — Web
npm run dev:web
# → http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Available Scripts

Run from the **project root**:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev:api` | Start Express API (nodemon, auto-restarts on changes) |
| `npm run dev:web` | Start Next.js frontend (hot reload) |
| `npm run build:api` | Compile API TypeScript to `apps/api/dist/` |
| `npm run build:web` | Build Next.js for production |
| `node scripts/test-and-report.mjs` | Run all tests and email the HTML report |

---

## Routes

### Public (no auth)

| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `/[companySlug]` | Company's public job board |
| `/[companySlug]/[roleId]` | Role detail page + application form |
| `/login` | Login page |

### Dashboard (auth required)

| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `/dashboard` | Stats, charts, recent applications |
| `/dashboard/applications` | All applications (search, filter, CSV export) |
| `/dashboard/applications/[id]` | Application detail — timeline, email history, stage |
| `/dashboard/templates` | Job roles list |
| `/dashboard/templates/new` | Create a new role |
| `/dashboard/templates/[id]/edit` | Edit role fields, stages, and settings |
| `/dashboard/email-templates` | Manage reusable email templates |
| `/dashboard/users` | Team member management |
| `/dashboard/settings` | Company name, slug, logo, hero image |

---

## API

The API runs at `http://localhost:3001` and follows a consistent response envelope:

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { ... } }
{ "success": false, "error": "..." }
```

Interactive API documentation (Scalar) is available at `http://localhost:3001/docs`.

---

## Testing

### Run all tests + get an HTML report emailed to you

```bash
node scripts/test-and-report.mjs
```

This runs the full backend (Vitest) and frontend (Playwright) test suites, generates a styled HTML report, and emails it via Resend.

### Backend tests only

```bash
cd apps/api
npx vitest run
```

### Frontend E2E tests only

```bash
cd apps/web
npx playwright test
```

To run a specific spec file:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/templates.spec.ts
```

### Test credentials

The Playwright suite uses credentials from environment variables (with fallbacks):

```env
TEST_EMAIL=your@email.com
TEST_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

Set these in `apps/api/.env` or export them in your shell before running tests.
